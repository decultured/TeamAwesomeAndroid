TeamAwesomeAndroid project from Startup Weekend Kansas City 2010

This is an android game called "NovaCraft" built in a weekend by a Startup Weekend team.  None of the team members had developed for android, or even installed the SDK before the weekend started.  By the end of 48 intense hours of coding, the game was fully functional, playable and included several enemies, special effects (through a custom particle engine), multiple levels, sound effects, custom artwork, and various other features.

The project won second place in the Startup Weekend judging.
